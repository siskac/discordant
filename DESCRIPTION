Description: Discordant is an R package that identifies pairs of features that 
    correlate differently between phenotypic groups, with application to -omics 
    data sets. Discordant uses a mixture model that “bins” molecular feature 
    pairs based on their type of coexpression or coabbundance. Algorithm is 
    explained further in "Differential Correlation for Sequencing Data"" (Siska 
    et al. 2016).
